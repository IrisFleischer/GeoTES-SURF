# GeoTES-SURF Project

## Closing Summary
Geological Thermal Energy Storage (GeoTES) is a project about renewable energy, utilizing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) wells and converting them into thermal batteries capable of storing thermal energy for several months. Excess energy from solar in the summer could be stored using these wells and drawn out again to be used in the winter, which could theoretically drastically reduce the use of fossil fuels for the state's winter energy consumption.  For more detailed information see [this](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/86609.pdf) article published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

 Our goal was to have a [CalTech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf) student to help with the initial modeling, which would advance the GeoTES project's progress as well as providing a research project to the student.

We were in the initial phase of proposing this to the CalTech SURF program when research revealed that advanced modeling had been proposed, funded, and was in the process of being carried out by NREL. 

We are in contact with the researchers involved and our project is on hold until the results of their modeling have been completed. 

### Status
